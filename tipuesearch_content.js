I heard about it on a podcast with the author. It's really down-to-earth, requires little math, and is especially for the self-taught programmer, students, and those who want a refresh. It covers things like graphs (for deciding what to pull in a complex build, for example), machine learning, and even neural nets. It is a \"breadth first\" book, in that he covers several topics not in depth, but to give you a taste for decding whether to learn more.

Here is a link to the slides . We didn't get to finish everything on strings, so we'll try to do that next session. (Go slices!) We are planning to do some live streaming on YouTube. This will take some time to get the kinks worked out. In preparation for live streaming, I suggest, I implore: please go to YouTube and subscribe to our channel! Once we have 100 subscribers, things are a lot easier with YouTube! It costs nothing (you don't even have to subscribe to notifications!), and it will help out this whole project. And if you need help installing Python, git, bash and Visual Studio Code for Windows, try the videos which are there.

Here is a link to the slides . The last slide shows 3 packages/applications which should be downloaded and installed. For now, ignore the git one (I think git is included in Visual Studio Code). So only need to install the following: Python 3.7 (or 3.6) - python.org - this is Python (CPython) itself. Recommended for Windows 10 users is to just download from the python.org site. Mac users can do that, or use brew. Linux users can use the native package manager, or download from the python.org site. NOTE: make sure you download the 64-bit version if indeed that is your OS flavor. Visual Studio Code - code.visualstudio.com - this is a nice IDE (integrated development environment) for coding and playing with Python and other languages. Give it a whirl. If it has problems, we can try something else. For all: just try installing from the site. And then add this extension (to support the Python language): Python Extension","tags":"meetup","url":"/python-meetup-1.html","loc":"/python-meetup-1.html"},{"title":"Python popularity","text":"Python Popularity There are many ways to measure this, but one thing is certain: Python today is one of the most popular languages, and has one of the highest growth rates of use. This could be due to several factors: the beauty, power and simplicity of the language itself as people see computers and coding as more important, the fact that Python is relatively easy to learn the rise of machine learning and data science, which has seen Python as a tremendous asset for expressing complex ideas, and glueing functionality of high-speed code from other languages together the rise of amazing tools like Python Notebooks (Jupyter) great continuing support for so many things: databases, machine learning, graphics, video, games, content management... support of the language from the biggest and brightest in the business, like Google, Spotify, Netflix and Dropbox","tags":"misc","url":"/python-popularity.html","loc":"/python-popularity.html"},{"title":"Introduction","text":"Our First Meeting Our first meeting is scheduled for January 16, 2019, at 7:00pm at the Fairfax Regional Library (10360 North St, Fairfax, VA 22030).
